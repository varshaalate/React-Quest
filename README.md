# Daily Dose Of React

A. Started With States and Props

B.  React Hooks 
    1. Use State
    2. Use Effect
    3. Use Ref
    4. Use Context


C. React Routes
 1. Relative Path :
- Does not start with /.
- Its context is relative to the parent route.
Example:
  Suppose inside /dashboard, you have nested routes like settings and profile.
  Using profile will resolve to /dashboard/profile.
  Use relative paths when working with nested routes.



2.Absolute Path
 - Always starts with /.
 - Its context starts from the root of the app, not from the parent route.
Example:
  /dashboard will always point to the dashboard page directly, regardless of nesting.
  Use absolute paths when you want to define a route from the application root.
